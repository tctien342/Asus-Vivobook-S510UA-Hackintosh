This repo has moved to the GitHub corner of the current maintainer **Lee Binder** because I gave my VivoBook away and he still runs his as a hackintosh. You can find the latest version there:

**[LeeBinder / Asus-Vivobook-S510UA-Hackintosh](https://github.com/LeeBinder/Asus-Vivobook-S510UA-Hackintosh/)**

For the purpose of providing an archive, you can still download the two previous releases from [this repo's release section](https://github.com/tctien342/Asus-Vivobook-S510UA-Hackintosh/releases).
